                    Good morning world! It's 10:00&nbsp;a.m.<br>
                    and I'm going to be making scrambled eggs <br>
                    and bacon. Would you like to join me?<br>

                <p>Great! It will take about 10 minutes if <br>
                    that's okay with you. After all, I want <br>
                    to make sure the food is cooked well. Do <br>
                    you want milk or <span style="color:orange">orange juice</span> to drink? <br>
